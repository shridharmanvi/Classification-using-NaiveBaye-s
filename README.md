================================
Predicting classes based on Naive Baye's Classifier


In this project, I am trying to predict the jobs which the users might apply to based on a training dataset. 
This is performed by using Naive Baye's Classification technique using Python.

Note: No external packages have been used. Naive Baye's algorithm has been implemented in this program.
